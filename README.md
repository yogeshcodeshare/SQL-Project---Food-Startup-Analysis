# SQL-Project---Food-Startup-Analysis
Project Description:

The goal of this project is to provide data-driven insights to assist in the decision-making process for a new food startup. The project involves analyzing data on restaurants in different sub-cities of a particular city to identify the most promising locations for a new food startup.

We will analyze factors such as the number of restaurants in each sub-city, the average ratings and costs of restaurants, and the number of highly rated restaurants. Using this information, we will identify the sub-cities with the highest potential for success and provide recommendations on product offerings and pricing strategies.

Overall, the project will provide valuable insights to help the business owner make informed decisions on the location and target market for the new food startup, as well as pricing and product offerings to maximize potential success.   

This is a SQL project for Swiggy, an online food delivery platform. The project involves creating two tables in the Swiggy database - "Bangalore" and "Monthly_order" - and importing data from CSV files into MySQL. The project then moves on to cleaning the data, followed by analyzing the data to answer business questions such as competition in each city for a new food startup, the average restaurant rating and cost in each sub-city, and the top demanded cuisines in select sub-cities based on average monthly orders. Finally, the project concludes by answering questions on the number of restaurants offering the top demanded cuisine in select sub-cities, the average cost of eating at a restaurant in each sub-city, and the average cost of a particular cuisine in each city.
